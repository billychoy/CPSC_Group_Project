# CPSC_Group_Project - World Happiness Index and Olympic Games in 2016
This is our first project in python which aims to find out the correlation between the number of medals earned in the Olympic Games with the Country Happiness Index. To avoid the factor of COVID-19, this report will use datasets in 2016, and 2017.
